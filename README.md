# Stroll Test UI

This project is created as part of Round 1 for the Flutter Developer position at Stroll. It showcases a simple UI with interactive components built using Flutter.
Overview

This project is a UI test application that focuses on building and displaying a basic user interface. It does not implement complex state management solutions, as simple setState() functionality is sufficient for toggling visibility and other interactions.
Features

A clean and simple layout designed to test UI concepts in Flutter.
Interactive elements like buttons and toggles to demonstrate basic functionality.
Platform-specific design considerations for both iOS and Android (using Cupertino and Material widgets).
